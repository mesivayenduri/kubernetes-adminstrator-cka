Initially When you setup a kubernetes cluster with kubeadm , you will be login as kubernetes-admin.

Now to create a new user, First you need to generate user certificates.

Ex: I want to create a user "Developer". For this I need to genrate private key, create CSR and approve CSR using CA

> openssl genrsa -out developer.key 2048
> openssl req -new -key developer.key -subj="/CN=Developer" -out developer.csr
> openssl x509 -req -in developer.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -out developer.crt


Now Create Role and Rolebinding Objects in kubernetes

Ex: 

developer-role.yaml

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: developer
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - pods
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
  - delete


developer-role-binding.yaml

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: developer-role-binding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: developer
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: Developer


Now update the config file under $HOME/.kube/.  with user and contexts. Refer sample-config file
